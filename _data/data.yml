    title: Summary of research
    summary: |
      My research focuses on the topology and geometry of smooth four-manifolds. The tools I use most often are trisections, Floer cohomology theories and their sheaf-theoretic counterparts, and quantum invariants. 
      You can find detailed descriptions, notes, and preprints of projects I'm currently working on below. I have a research blog where I share my thoughts on current developments and trends in the field--beware:
      I also have quite a bit of speculation on it too. 
education:
    - degree: PhD in mathematics
      university: University of Georgia
      time: 2014 - 2020
      details: |
        Supervised by David T. Gay. My thesis focused on using relative trisections to 
        compute the relative invariants of Ozsvath and Szabo in Heegaard Floer homology.
          - Thesis defense
          - Thesis: Trisections and Ozsvath-Szabo four-manifold invariants
    - degree: BSc in Mathematics
