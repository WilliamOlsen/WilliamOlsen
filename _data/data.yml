    title: Research
    summary: |
      My research focuses on the topology and geometry of smooth four-manifolds. The tools I use most often are trisections, Floer cohomology theories and their sheaf-theoretic counterparts, and quantum invariants. 
      You can find detailed descriptions, notes, and preprints of projects I'm currently working on below. I have a research blog where I share my thoughts on current developments and trends in the field--beware:
      I also have quite a bit of speculation on it too. 
education:
    - degree: PhD in mathematics
      university: University of Georgia
      time: 2014 - 2020

        Supervised by David T. Gay. My thesis focused on using relative trisections to 
        compute the relative invariants of Ozsvath and Szabo in Heegaard Floer homology.

    intro: |
      My work is centers on developing the theory of trisections of four-manifolds, as introduced by Gay and Kirby. 
      So far, this has meant applying techniques of modern symplectic geometry in the form of Heegaard Floer and
      quilted Floer cohomology to this geometric situation.

      - title: Trisections and Ozsvath-Szabo cobordism invariants

        authors: William E. Olsen
        date: February 2021
        details: | 
          Given a smooth four-manifold with connected boundary and equipped with a trisected Morse
          2-function we demonstrate how to compute the relative invariant of Ozsvath and Szabo in the 
          setting of Heegaard Floer homology.

        authors: Johan Asplund and William E. Olsen
        date: In preparation
        details: | 
          Given a knotted 2-sphere embedded in four-space, we prove a colimit formula for computing 
          the Legendrian dga associated to the conormal lift.

      - title: Alexander invariants of 2-knots and bridge-trisections

teaching:
    - course: REU topology mentor
      time: Summer 2021 (virtual)
      company: University of Virginia
      details: |
        As a beneficiary of UVA's RTG grant, I happily occupied a mentorship role in a topology REU during Summer 2021. My primary responsibilities were two-fold:
        I gave an introductory minicourse on classical knot theory and I supervised a group of four undergraduate students through a research project which studied 
        the Alexander invariants of knotted 2-spheres embedded in four-space. You can find the notes from the minicourse and our final paper below.
          - Introductory knot theory course.
          - Alexander invariants of bridge-trisected 2-knots.
    - course: MATH 8750 Topology of Manifolds 
      time: Fall 2021
      company: University of Virginia
      details: |
        An introduction to smooth four-manifold topology with an eye towards the applicationss of trisections and the constructions of 
        small exotic four-manifolds.
