    title: Research
    summary: |
      I'm a low-dimensional topologist with a special interest in dimension four. I'm particularly interested in the development and application of the theory of trisections of four-manifolds. 
      The tools I use most often are trisections, Floer cohomology theories, and their sheaf-theoretic counterparts.

        Supervised by David T. Gay. My thesis focused on using relative trisections to 
        compute the relative invariants of Ozsvath and Szabo in Heegaard Floer homology.

    title: Publications
    intro: |
      My work is centers on developing the theory of trisections of four-manifolds, as introduced by Gay and Kirby. 
      So far, this has meant applying techniques of modern symplectic geometry in the form of Heegaard Floer and
      quilted Floer cohomology to this geometric situation. 
    papers:
      - title: Trisections and Ozsvath-Szabo cobordism invariants
        link: "#"
        authors: William E. Olsen
        date: February 2021
        details: | 
          Given a smooth four-manifold with connected boundary and equipped with a trisected Morse
          2-function we demonstrate how to compute the relative invariant of Ozsvath and Szabo in the 
          setting of Heegaard Floer homology.

      - title: Microlocal sheaves and bridge-trisected surface knots
        link: "#"
        authors: Honghao Gao and William E. Olsen
        date: In preparation
        details: | 
          One can associate to any codimension two embedding its unit conormal lift. Here, we study the microlocal sheaf category
          of Kashiwara and Schapira associated to tangles and knotted surfaces in four-space, and we prove a homotopy limit formula
          which computes these categories using a local-to-global approach.

      - title: Alexander invariants of 2-knots and bridge-trisections
        link: "#"
        authors: Ethan Clelland, Calvin Godfrey, Alexandra Emmons, Lusa Grisales, and William E. Olsen
        date: In preparation
        
teaching:
    - course: REU topology mentor
      time: Summer 2021 (virtual)
      company: University of Virginia
      details: |
        In the summer of 2021, I participated as a mentor for the topology REU hosted by UVA. My primary responsibilities were two-fold:
        I wrote an introductory minicourse on classical knot theory, and I supervised a group of six students (four undergraduate partipants and two graduate student mentors) through a research project which studied 
        the Alexander invariants of knotted 2-spheres embedded in four-space. 

    - course: MATH 8750 Topology of Manifolds 
      time: Fall 2021
      company: University of Virginia
      details: |
        An introduction to smooth four-manifold topology with an eye towards the applicationss of trisections and the constructions of 
        small exotic four-manifolds.
