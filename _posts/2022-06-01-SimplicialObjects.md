A trisected four-manifold (X, T) gives rise to a preferred covering of the four-manifold X by open sets. Using the Cech nerve of this preferred covering one can associate simplicial objects in categories of interest.


This construction has many interesting applications to the smooth topology of X. We start with a brief review of this construction.
