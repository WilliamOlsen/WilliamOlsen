  I subscribe to <a href = "http://fardila.com/">Federico Ardilaâ€™s axioms</a>:
  <ol>
  <li> Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.</li>
  <li> Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.</li>
  <li> Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.</li>
  <li> Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.</li>
  </ol>
